                <p>Well, I'm just a stranger, I'm only a walker</p>
                <p>I guess I am human, but sometimes I feel</p>
                <p>Like I'm only a ghost, like I'm only a wall</p>
                <p>And if you come around, honey, I'll probably just follow you home</p>
                <p>'Cause it's all that I know how to do</p>
                <p>I was born by a body, I'll die by one too</p>
                <p>And places ain't nothing if it ain't got you</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>And one day, I'ma be a steam boat, baby</p>
                <p>One day, I can be a freight train lady</p>
                <p>I'll roll down the river and the miles won't phase me</p>
                <p>Oh, I wish I was better at being alone</p>
                <p>Still, every night, I call you on the phone</p>
                <p>Oh, I wish I was more than my skin and my bones</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>I've been arranging each of my movements</p>
                <p>And all of my gestures and trying to fool myself</p>
                <p>Into thinking that everything is small, that nothing has reason</p>
                <p>I woke up and cried, a convulsion of honesty brought me to life</p>
                <p>When I thought I was gone</p>
                <p>But I can't put a lie in the mouth of a song</p>
