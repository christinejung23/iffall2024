    <p class="instruction">Some sources say she ate the salad every day for 10 years while filming the show Friends, but after a little research I found that this is actually a salad she shared while doing an Instagram takeover for the Living Proof brand. In the caption Aniston said the salad, with bulgur, cucumbers, parsley, mint, red onion, chickpeas, feta cheese and pistachios was her “perfect salad.”</p>

        <p class="instruction">I liked the calm, minimalistic, yet decorated feel of this website. I think that each recipe is easy to navigate. There is also a dinstinctive visual system that I appreciate, with similar filters on imagery, as well as typefaces that fit to the cooking aesthetic. I like the use of black lines as borders and yellow as subtle highlights.</p>
